#Within this SQL, I will be querying a database with multiple tables to quantify the statistics of customers and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE PRODUCT = 'iPhone';
    
#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
    FROM BIT_DB.customers 
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderid;
    
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? (For this question, I made TWO different queries)
#Query A:
SELECT DISTINCT PRODUCT, price
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE price 
    IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#Query B:
SELECT DISTINCT PRODUCT, price 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
    
#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity) * PRICE
    AS revenue, product
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY Product;
    
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity) * PRICE
    AS revenue 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY product;
    
#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), 
    AVG(QUANTITY * PRICE)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
    ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
    WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2;
    
#Filtering data by dates

SELECT orderdate
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales    
    WHERE orderdate 
    BETWEEN '02/13/19 00:00' 
    AND '02/18/19 00:00';
    
SELECT location         
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales    
    WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';
    
SELECT sum(quantity)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE orderdate 
    LIKE '02/18/19%';
    
SELECT DISTINCT product 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE product     
    LIKE '%Batteries%';
    
SELECT DISTINCT product 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE price 
    LIKE '%.99';
    
SELECT product, sum(quantity)
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location    
    LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
    GROUP BY product;
